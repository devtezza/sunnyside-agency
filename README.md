## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

- This was my first time using a preprocessor for CSS (I choosed SASS). The challenge was an opportunity to practice some basic SASS knowledge.
- When it comes to Javascript, I had a similar experience, but in a lower level. The amount of Javascript code used in this challenge was really tiny when compared to CSS (SCSS), but it was a good start.
- Finally, it's important to mention that this challenge was the first time I used pure CSS and Javascript to build a responsive menu. Previously, I have utilized Bootstrap for the same purpose.
CSS Grid and Flexbox training, instead of Bootstrap (or other CSS framework) has been a productive way to deal with responsive design elements.

### Continued development

- Althought this challenge was a great opportunity to practice SASS, i have to learn how to organize the code properly, and how to take more advantage of its resources (variables, functions, mixins).
- In order to practice Javascript, I need to choose projects that make more use of it.


### Useful resources

- [Article/Tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - This article helped me to find a way to easily change svg color: CSS filter. I have used filters before, but not in a eficient way. Some tips of this article led me to the next resource, a CSS filter generator.
- [CSS Filter Generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This tool calculates the correct values of CSS filter property functions to generate a desired color. It helped me to change the color of svg icons on hover state.
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - It saved a lot of time by generating browser prefixes.
- [vanilla-navbar-menu](https://github.com/heyrizaldev/vanilla-navbar-menu) - It helped me to get a hint on how to build a responsive menu with no framework (only pure CSS/SASS and Javascript). I just adapted the code to fit my needs on this challenge.
